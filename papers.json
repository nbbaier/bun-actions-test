    "abstract": "The current understanding of the Language Faculty in modern linguistics in two mutually exclusive alternatives, reflecting two competing visions of language, i.e. either as a bioprogram fully specified for complex grammar , or emergent from a combination of a number of non-specific cognitive properties is too simplistic. From usage-based perspective the language system, is shaped by the linguistic experiences of the normal adult human . These are reflections of the internal complexity of the individual's social life social interactions which are of three major types: at professional level with colleagues and co-workers, at a personal level with family members, e.g.friends, neighbours, and community members, and occasional interactions with strangers, i.e fellow humans. The article argues that these 3 types of communicative interactions form three types of sub-systems in language use which co-exist, labeled here as code-like system, inferential system and protolanguage-like or primitive/rudimentary language systems. Acknowledging the fact that the linguistic output of the normal adult language user is structured in reflection of one's communicative experiences, and not a heterogeneous structureless sum of utterances, as the current dominant orthodoxy presumes, sheds a new light on our understanding of the language system, as it is shaped by language use. Most importantly, starting from these well founded premisses, the article argues that the innate propensity for learning and processing of the very essentials of language, i.e. the most primitive language systems, is more likely to reflect the content of the innate Language Faculty, while the other two subsystems reflect significant participation of a broad range of cognitive resources implicated in some ways in language learning and use. Such understanding of the Language Faculty makes the study of language evolution less of a mystery. ",
